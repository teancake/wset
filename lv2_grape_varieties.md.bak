Grape varieties

Pinot noir is a black grape variety with a thin skin. It requires a cool to moderate climate in order to produce good-quality grapes. If the growing conditions are too warm, the grapes can lose their fresh fruit flavours and taste unattractively cooked. Pinot noir is prone to rot and disease. In poor vintages it can be a struggle to produce even small amounts of good-quality pinot noir. As a wine, pinot noir is usually pale to medium in colour. On the palate it is high in acidity with low to medium tannins. It has red-fruit flavours (strawberry, raspberry, red cherry) that can range from fresh to cooked depending on the ripeness of the grapes. Pinot noir is most commonly produced as a single-varietal wine, with the notable exception of sparkling wines such as Champagne. It is often matured in oak, but strong flavours from small new-oak barrels can easily overwhelm a delicately flavoured pinot noir. Older and  or larger barrels are often used as they impart less flavour. The best pinot noirs often have subtle oak-derived aromas, e.g. smoke, cloves, that are balanced by the fruit flavours. Although most pinot noirs are intended to be consumed while they are youthful and fruity, some very good or outstanding examples can develop complex tertiary flavours, e.g. forest floor, mushroom in the bottle and may take several years to show their full potential.

Zinfandel or primitivo is a grape variety that established its reputation in two different countries. In California in the USA it is called Zinfandel; in Italy, notably the southern region of Puglia, it is called Primitivo. It is a black grape variety that needs a warm climate to ripen successfully. As it ripens, its flavours change from red fruits e.g. strawberries, raspberries to black fruits e.g. plums, black cherries. Sometimes some grape within the bunch start to raisin before the others have ripened. This gives high sugar levels and flavours of dried fruit e.g. prune, raisins. 

Riesling is a cold-hardy white grape variety that prefers cool to moderate climates. With its naturally high acidity and susceptibility to botrytis or noble rot, it is suitable for the production of outstanding-quality wines at all sweetness levels. Today, Riesling is produced across the world in a variety of styles. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety the produces wines with pronounced fruity and floral aromas and high acidity. The specific fruit flavours in the wine vary according to the level of ripeness in the grapes at the time of harvest. Grapes that are just-ripe produce wines with flavours of green fruit e.g. apple, pear and citrus fruit e.g. lemon, lime. Extra-ripe grapes give flavours of stone fruit e.g. peach, apricot, tropical fruit e.g. mango, pineapple and sometimes even dried fruit e.g. dried apricots, raisins.  Styles of riesling range from dry to sweet and from light to full in body. As a variety that retains acidity and builds up sugar and flavour slowly, riesling is suitable for late-harvesting in regions where there are dry, sunny autumn conditions. A grape's sugars, acidity and flavours can be concentrated by late-harvesting, through effect of botrytis or as a result of the grapes freezing on the vine. Riesling's high natural acidity is perfect for balancing high levels of sweetness. Riesling produces dry, off-dry, medium and sweet white wines. Off-dry or medium styles are usually made by interrupting the fermentation by removing the yeast, which leaves a wine with lower alcohol and some residual sugar, or by the addition of sterile grape juice, e.g. sussreserve. The sweetest styles are made using extra-ripe grapes; the grape juice is so high in sugar that the fermentation stops naturally. Wine makers typically ferment Riesling in inert vessels such as stainless-steel tanks to preserve its floral aromas. The finest Riesling wines can age for years or even decades in the bottle. High natural acidity preserves the freshness of the wine while it develops complex tertiary flavours of honey and petrol or gasoline. 

Chenin Blanc is one of the wine world's most versatile white grape varieties. It grows well in cool, moderate and warm climates and its flavours vary according to ripeness from green fruit apple and citrus fruit lemon through to stone fruit peach and tropical fruit pineapple, mango. Its natural high acidity makes it suitable for late harvesting and it is also susceptible to botrytis or noble rot. These features mean that Chenin Blanc is made in a very broad range of styles from dry through to sweet. Both oaked and unoaked styles are produced. Due to its high acidity, very good or outstanding-quality examples can age in the bottle for many years. 

Semillon is a white grape variety that grows primarily in moderate and warm climates. In youth, Semillon wines typically have simple primary flavours of apple, lemon and grass. Depending on ripeness, semillon wines can range from medium to high in acidity and light to full in body. Some examples can age very well, evolving complex tertiary notes of dried fruit, nuts and honey in the bottle.

Furmint is a white grape variety that is grown most widely in Hungary. It has naturally high acidity and is very susceptible to botrytis, making it ideal for the production of sweet wines. Furmint is the most planted grape variety of the Tokaj region of north-east Hungary. Although Tokaj also produces dry and medium wines, it is most famous for producing Tokaji Aszu, a sweet wine made from grapes that have been affected by botrytis. Furmint is the principal grape variety used to make these wines, though it is often blended with other local grape varieties for greater aroma complexity.  Tokaji Aszu is always sweet. A good indication of the amount of sweetness is the number of Puttonyos on the label. A Tokaji aszu will be labelled either as 5 puttonyos or 6 puttonyos, with the 6 puttonyos having more sweetness than the 5 puttonyos. Tokaji aszu wines are amber in colour as they traditionally spend a significant amount of time ageing in oak. On the nose, the wines are pronounced with a combination of primary, secondary and tertiary aromas. These include fresh and dried stone fruits apricots, citrus fruits, oak-derived aromas, vanilla, smoke and typically, aromas of deliberate oxidation, e.g. caramel. The sweetness and full body are balanced by high acidity and the finish is typically long and intense. Tokaji aszu wines are considered some of the best and most complex sweet wines int eh world. The quality is usually very good or outstanding and the wines continue to develop complex flavours for many years in the bottle. 

Chardonnay is a white grape variety that is prized for its ability to produce outstanding-quality wines in cool, moderate and warm climates. It produces a broad range of dry white wines, from inexpensive high-volume brands to premium-quality wines that can evolve for decades in the bottle. The flavours that can be found in Chardonnay wines are many and varied. Its primary fruit aromas and the degree of alcohol, body and acidity are all greatly affected by the climate in which the grapes are grown. A typical cool-climate chardonnay has high acidity, light to medium body and flavours of green fruit apple, pear, citrus fruit, lemon, lime and wet stones. A typical moderate-climate chardonnay has medium to high acidity, medium to full body and flavours of lemon, stone fruit peach and sometimes tropical fruit melon. A typical warm-climate chardonnay is full-bodied, medium in acidity and dominated by flavours of stone fruit peach and tropical fruit pineapple, banana. Acidification, the process of adding extra acid during wine making, is commonplace for many warm-climate chardonnays to balance the alcohol and body of the wine. Alongside its varied primary fruit flavours, it is common to taste secondary flavours from various winemaking processes in wines made from chardonnay. Malolactic conversion can add dairy flavours butter, cream and soften harsh acids. Lees contact during maturation can add body and flavours of bread and biscuit. Oak barrel fermentation and or maturation is also commonly used to add body and flavours some, vanilla, coconut. Some winemakers may use oak chips or staves to impart these flavours as they are less expensive than new-oak barrels. It is important to note that the above methods are all optional. Strong secondary flavours can easily overwhelm lightly flavoured wines; only wines of sufficient flavour intensity will benefit from these winemaking processes. Some producers prefer not to add secondary flavours to their chardonnay. They use inert vessels and may avoid malolactic conversion and or lees contact. Wines made without oak treatment may be labelled unoaked or unwooded to communicate this to the consumer. Very good or outstanding quality chardonnays can age in the bottle for years or even decades, gathering complex tertiary flavours hazelnut, mushroom. 

Sauvignon blanc is an aromatic white grape variety that is best known for producing dry wines with distinctive herbaceous aromas and refreshing high acidity. Though it is considered to be a French variety, it is now widely grown in cool and moderate climates around the world. It produces wines that are most commonly unoaked and best consumed while young and fresh. Sauvignon blanc is an aromatic white grape variety that grows best in cool and moderate climates. It typically produces dry wines that are light to medium in body with high acidity. Its wines are characterised by their pronounced herbaceous e.g. grass, green bell pepper or capsicum, asparagus and floral blossom aromas. Primary flavours vary according to ripeness from green fruits apple, gooseberry and wet stones, to riper flavours of tropical fruit passion fruit. Complexity can be gained by blending grapes from different vineyard sites with varying degrees of ripeness. Sauvignon blanc is usually seen as a single-varietal wine, though it is sometimes blended with Semillon. Single-varietal wines made from Sauvignon blanc are most commonly produced in inert vessels; their distinctive herbaceous characters may be easily overwhelmed by the flavours of new oak. If oak has been used during winemaking, it will typically be indicated by terms such as barrel aged. Wines made from sauvignon blanc are usually best consumed when young. Even outstanding examples can lose their fresh aromas within a couple of years of the vintage and develop unattractive vegetal notes. 
 
Pinot Grigio and Pinot Gris are two names for the same white grape variety. Pinot Grigio is the Italian name and Pinot Gris is the French name. It grows primarily in cool or moderate climates and produces two distinct styles that are determined principally by grape-growing and harvesting choices. Pinot Grigio is very versatile in the vineyard and produces two very distinct styles of wine. The most common style is made from high yields of grapes that are harvested early while acidity is high. The result is a dry, light-bodied wine with high acidity and simple flavours of apple and lemon. A very different style can be created when yields are controlled and the harvesting of the grapes is delayed. The riper grapes are higher in sugar, lower in acidity and more complex in flavour. From these grapes it is possible to produce a powerful, full bodied wine with medium acidity and pronounced flavours of lemon, stone fruit peach and tropical fruit mango, banana. Pinot Grigio or Pinot gris is typically fermented in inert vessels to preserve its fruity flavours. The lighter Italian style is almost always fermented to dryness, while producers of the riper, fuller-bodied style sometimes interrupt the fermentation by removing the yeasts to retain an off-dry or medium level of sweetness. Lighter styles of Pinot Grigio are best consumed while fresh and young, as their simple flavours fade within a short time in the bottle. The more concentrated full-bodied examples can develop notes of ginger and honey over time in bottle. 
 
Gewurztraminer is an aromatic variety that grows best in cool to moderate climates. It creates powerfully scented wines that range from dry to sweet in style. Gewurztraminer grapes accumulate high levels of sugar during ripening. When the juice is fermented to dryness, the result is a high-alcohol wine. A typical Gewurztraminer is full-bodied with low to medium acidity. It has pronounced floral aromas rose as well as stone-fruit peach, apricot and tropical fruit lychee flavours. Gewurztraminer is typically unoaked to preserve its floral aromas. Very good or outstanding examples can develop flavours of honey and dried fruit in the bottle.

Viognier is an aromatic grape variety that is mainly grown in moderate climates. A typical Viognier is dry with low to medium acidity, high alcohol and a medium to full body. Its wines have pronounced floral aromas blossom and stone-fruit flavours peach, apricot. Most wines are fermented in inert vessels but, usually for an aromatic variety, some oak-aged Viogniers are made. 

Albarino is a white grape variety that is grown in the cool Rias Baixas DO region in the north-west corner of Spain. Close to the Atlantic Ocean, this region is notably cooler, wetter and cloudier than Spain's other wine-producing regions. This means that it is well suited to the production of refreshing white wines. A typical Albarino is dry with high acidity. It is medium bodied with flavours of citrus fruit lemon, grape fruit and stone fruit peach, apricot. Albarino is most commonly an unoaked wine that is intended to be drunk when young. Sometimes a small amount of lees contact is used to add body and complexity.   

Merlot is a black grape variety that grows in moderate and warm climates. A single-varietal Merlot is typically a dry wine with medium acidity and medium tannins. Its primary characters vary according to ripeness. Just-ripe Merlot grapes produce light to medium bodied wines with red-fruit flavours strawberry, red plum and herbaceous notes green bell pepper capsicum. Riper merlot grapes can produce wines with medium to full body and cooked-black-fruit flavours blackberry, black plum. This riper style is easily achieved in a warm climate but can also be achieved by harvesting later in a moderate climate. While it is capable of making outstanding single-varietal wines, Merlot is often blended with higher-tannin varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon to achieve a particular style of wine. Merlot adds red-fruit flavours to these blends and can lower the tannin levels, making them ready to drink at an earlier stage. Both oaked and unoaked styles are made; while a lighter style of Merlot has little need for extended barrel maturation, a fuller bodied style may benefit from the softness and flavour complexity gained through oak maturation. The best Merlot-dominated wines are age-worthy, developing notes of dried fruit and tobacco over time.  
Cabernet Sauvignon is a black grape variety from south-west France. It is notable for its pronounced black-fruit and herbaceous aromas, high tannins and high acidity. Due to these natural features, it can produce outstanding-quality red wines that mature and develop for many years in the bottle. It is the grape variety behind many of the most famous wines from the Left Bank of Bordeaux in France. Today, outstanding examples are made throughout the wine-producing world. Cabernet Sauvignon grows in moderate and warm climates, though in a moderate climate it can struggle to ripen in all but the warmest sites. Its grapes have thick skins that contain high levels of colour, flavour and tannin. These skins need a long and warm growing season to ripen fully. A single-varietal Cabernet Sauvignon will be deeply coloured. On the palate it will be dry, high in acidity, high in tannins, and medium to full in body. It will have pronounced flavours of black fruit blackcurrant, black cherry and usually herbal mint or herbaceous notes green bell pepper capsicum. In warm climates, its fruit flavours can become cooked in character. Cabernet Sauvignon can be found as a single-varietal wine, though it is often blended with other varieties such as Merlot. Blending can help to soften Cabernet Sauvignon's very high levels of tannin and acidity. This may be particularly important in cooler vintages in moderate climate regions, where Cabernet Sauvignon may struggle to ripen. A newly fermented Cabernet Sauvignon can taste unpleasantly tannic. It will often be matured in oak barrels for several months or even years before it is bottled. Oak maturation allows small amounts of oxygen into the wine: this helps to soften the tannins. A new-oak barrel will also impart complex secondary flavours smoke, vanilla, cloves.  Cabernet Sauvignon's high levels of tannin and acidity act as natural preservatives. Very good or outstanding examples can mature over many years in the bottle. Over time, its tannin soften and the wine develops complex tertiary flavours, dried fruits, earth, forest floor. 

Syrah or Shiraz is a thick-skinned black variety with small grapes. It requires a moderate to warm climate to ripen fully and produces wines with medium to high levels of tannins and acidity. A moderate-climate Syrah Shiraz is typically medium in body with fresh black-fruit flavours black cherry, blackberry, herbal notes and black-pepper aromas. This is the signature style of the Northern Rhone where it is known as Syrah. A warm-climate Syrah or Shiraz is typically full-bodied and high in alcohol with ripe flavours of cooked black fruits and liquorice. This riper style is common in the warmer parts of Australia where the wines are known as Shiraz. Outside of France and Australia, the use of one name over the other can give the consumer an idea of which style the wine has been made in.  Syrah or Shiraz is responsible for many very high-quality single varietal wines, but is also used to add colour, black-fruit flavours and tannins to blends. It is most commonly blended with grapes that are local to the southern Rhone such as Grenache. These wines are sometimes referred to as Rhone Blends. Oak maturation is common in the production of Syrah or Shiraz wines. It Is used both to soften the tannins of the wine and to add flavours of smoke and spice. Very good or outstanding wines from Syrah or Shiraz are often suitable for bottle ageing due to their intense flavours and tannins. For the finest examples, this ageing period can extend to a decade or more. Over time, dried-fruit flavours emerge as well as notes of leather, meat and earth. 

Gamay is a black grape variety that produces wines with high acidity, low to medium tannins and red-fruit flavours raspberry, red cherry, red plum. Wines made from Gamay are usually produced in inert vessels and rarely display aromas from oak. The most important region for Gamay is Beaujolais in France, a moderate-climate region directly to the south of Burgundy. Winemakers here commonly use techniques that maximise colour extraction while minimising tannin extraction. These techniques can create aromas of banana and candy. A typical Beaujolais is light bodied with low to medium tannins and red-fruit flavours. 

Grenache or Garnacha is thought to have evolved in Spain where it is called Garnacha. From there it spread through the south of France and into the Rhone Valley. Once in France its name changed to Grenache and this is the name that is most commonly used in the rest of the world. Grenache is a black grape variety that needs a warm climate to ripen successfully. When ripe, Grenache grapes typically have high levels of sugar and low acidity. It is a thin-skinned variety and its wines are typically low to medium in tannins and have red-fruit flavours strawberry, red plum, red cherry and sometimes spice, white pepper, liquorice. Grenache produces its finest wines when yields are carefully controlled. Due to its red-fruit flavours Grenache is commonly used to make rose wines using the short maceration method. These wines can range from dry to medium in sweetness and are typically intended to be consumed chilled while young and fruity. Grenache is often blended with other black varieties, such as Syrah in France and Tempranillo in Spain. These varieties add colour, acidity and tannins to Grenache-based wines. Many simple Grenache-based wines are unoaked, but very good or outstanding-quality wines are often matured in barrels to add flavour complexity. Some producers favour old oak over new, due to Grenache's delicate red-fruit flavours. Over time in the bottle, Grenache can develop complex flavours of earth, meat and dried fruit. 


Tempranillo is Spain's most prized black variety and is a key component of many of the country's most famous red wines. Wines made from Tempranillo typically have medium acidity, medium levels of tannins and red-fruit flavours strawberry, red cherry and black-fruit flavours blackberry, black plum.  Tempranillo is a versatile grape that makes a range of dry red wines from simple, fruity and inexpensive to ripe, complex and age worthy. For wines intended for long-term ageing, small proportions of other grape varieties may be blended in to increase acidity and tannins. It is traditional in many parts of Spain to mature Tempranillo based wines in small new oak barrels. The oak imparts complex secondary flavours, vanilla, smoke, cedar into the wines as well as softening tannins and contributing to body. It is also common for winemakers to age their best wines for a period of time in bottle before releasing them onto the market. Very good or outstanding-quality Tempranillo can develop complex tertiary flavours of mushroom, leather and dried fruit in the bottle. 

Carmenere is a black variety that is widely grown in Chile. It is native to Bordeaux but is rarely found there now. It needs a long, sunny growing season to ripen successfully. Even in Chile, it can struggle to ripen in all but the warmest and sunniest sites of the central valley. If harvested when the grapes are not fully ripe, Carmenere produces wines with pungent herbaceous characters such as green bell pepper capsicum and tomato leaf. When ripe, it gives wines with fresh black fruit flavours blackberry and herbal notes eucalyptus. A typical Carmenere is deeply coloured with medium to high acidity, high tannins and a full body. It is often matured in oak barrels to soften its tannins and add flavours coffee, chocolate. Very good or outstanding examples can develop tertiary flavours. It can be found as a single-varietal wine, though it is more commonly found as part of a blend with other varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.

Malbec is Argentina's most important black grape variety. Like Carmenere, Malbec is native to south-west France but has adapted well to the warmer south American climate. It is grown widely in Argentina, but the majority of plantings are in the high-altitude region of Mendoza. Malbel typically produces deeply coloured, full-bodied wines with high tannins and flavours of black fruits blackberry, black plum. Maturation in new oak lends softness and spicy flavours clove, vanilla. In the bottle, very good or outstanding examples can develop flavours of dried fruit and meat. It is common to blend Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and or Merlot, but it is also frequently seen as a single-varietal wine. 

Unlike Carmenere and Malbec, which are French in origin, Pinotage was developed specially for the warm, dry climate of South Africa. It is closely related to Pinot Noir and produces wines with similar red-fruit flavours strawberry, raspberry, red cherry. It is grown throughout the Western Cape. Its wines typically have medium tannins and high acidity. The style of wine it produces range from fruity, medium-bodied wines to powerful full-bodied examples with concentrated red-fruit flavours. If produced in contact with oak, Pinotage can take on pronounced aromas of coffee, chocolate and smoke. It can be found as single-varietal wine or as part of a blend with other grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. These blended wines are commonly referred as Cape Blends.

Cortese produces dry, light-bodied white wines with high acidity. They display light floral aromas blossom and flavours of green fruit apple, pear and citrus lemon. Cortese is best known as the variety used in the wines of Gavi DOCG in the Piemonte region of northwest Italy. Gavi is typically fermented in inert vessels and is not matured in oak. Most Gavi is ready to drink on release and is not intended to age. 

Garganega produces dry, medium bodied wines with high acidity. Its wines have flavours of green fruit apple, pear, citrus fruit lemon and stone fruit peach. Garganega is widely planted in the Veneto region in northeast Italy and is the most important variety in the wines of Soave DOC and Soave Classico DOC. Soave is typically fermented in inert vessels and is not matured in oak. Most Soave DOC should be drunk while young and fresh. The best wines of Soave Classico DOC can gain complex flavours of honey and almonds in the bottle. Recioto di Soave DOCG is a sweet white wine made from grapes that have been harvested and dried using a method called appassimento. 

Verdicchio produces dry wines with high acidity, medium body and flavours of green fruit apple, pear and citrus fruit lemon, and herbal notes fennel. Most wines labelled Verdicchio are simple, fruity and not intended for ageing. Outstanding examples can develop flavours of honey and nuts in the bottle. It is widely planted in central Italy, particularly in the Marche region on the east coast. The most famous wine from the Verdicchio grape is Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi DOC. 

Fiano produces wines with medium acidity, medium to full body and flavours of stone fruit peach and tropical fruit melon, mango. Many producers ferment Fiano in inert vessels but some examples have secondary aromas from lees contact bread, biscuit or oak smoke. It is often made to be drunk young, though some very good or outstanding examples can develop complex aromas of honey in the bottle. Fiano is a an important white grape variety in southern Italy. Fiano di Avellino DOCG is a wine from the mountainous region of Campania. 

Nebbiolo produces wines with high acidity and high tannins. Its wines have distinctive red-fruit aromas red cherry, red plum, notes of dried herbs and sometimes floral characters rose, violet. It is often matured for extended periods of time in oak to soften its high levels of tannin. Some producers choose to use old-oak barrels; others use new-oak barrels instead in order to add new oak aromas to their wines. Nebbiolo's high acidity and high tannins mean that its wines often improve with bottle age. Over time, the best examples can gain complex tertiary aromas of mushrooms, tobacco and leather. Nebbiolo is the only variety permitted in the wines of Barolo DOCG, perhaps the most famous wine of the Piemonte region in northwest Italy. 

Barbera produces wines with high acidity and low to medium tannins. It gives aromas of red fruit red cherries, red plums and sometimes black pepper. Many barbera wines are unaoked and fruity, while some producers mature their wines for a period of time in oak to add flavour complexity. As with Nebbiolo, Barbera is a widely grown in the Piemonte region of north west Italy. Barbera d'Asti DOCG is considered by many to produce Barbera's highest-quality wines. Due to its lower tannin levels, Barbera is generally enjoyable to drink at a younger stage than Nebbiolo, and typically has less ageing potential. 

Corvina produces wines that are low to medium in tannins and high in acidity with red-fruit flavours red cherry, red plum. Corvina is the most important grape variety of Valpolicella, in the Veneto region of north-east Italy. Appassimento is widely used in the Veneto region. It involves picking the grapes and drying them indoors to concentrate their sugars, acids, tannins and flavours. Amarone della Valpolicella DOCG is a dry to off-dry red wine made from grapes that have been partially dried in this way. The result is a full-bodied wine with high alcohol, high tannins and pronounced flavours of fresh fruit, red cherries and dried fruit, prunes, raisins, figs. Recioto della Valpolicella DOCG is a sweet red wine made from partially dried grapes. The grapes have such concentrated sugars that the yeast cannot ferment them to dryness. 

Sangiovese produces dry wines with high tannins, high acidity and flavours of red fruits, red cherries, red plums and dried herbs. It is widely planted in Italy but is mostly famous for producing the red wines of Chianti in central Tuscany. 

Montepulciano produces deeply coloured wines with medium acidity, high tannins and black-fruit flavours black plum, black cherry. It is best known for producing Montepulciano d'Abruzzo DOC from the Abruzzo region in east-central Italy.
